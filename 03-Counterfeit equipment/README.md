# Counterfeit equipment

## Summary

Among the many `SSDT` patches, a considerable number of patches can be classified as counterfeit device patches, such as:

-Some devices do not exist in ACPI, but the MAC system needs them. The correct description of these devices through the patch can load the device driver. Such as "05-2-PNLF Injection Method", "Add Missing Components", "Counterfeit Ethernet", etc.
-EC issues. Such as "Counterfeit EC".
-For some special devices, the method of prohibiting the original device from counterfeiting it will bring us convenience in adjusting the patch. Such as "OCI2C-TPXX Patch Method".
-A certain device is disabled for some reason, but the MAC system needs it to work. See examples in `this chapter`.
-In most cases, you can also enable the device by using "Binary Rename and Preset Variables".

## Counterfeit Equipment

-Features
  
  -The counterfeit device already exists in ACPI, and the code is relatively short, few, and independent.
  
  -The original device has the canonical `_HID` or `_CID`.
  -Even if the original device is not disabled, using a counterfeit device patch will not cause ACPI damage.
  
- Claim

  -The name of the counterfeit device is **different** from the original device name of ACPI.

  -The content of the patch is **same** as the main content of the original device.

  -The `_STA` part of the counterfeit patch should include the following to ensure that the windows system uses the original ACPI.

    ```Swift
        Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)
        {
            If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
            {
                ...
                Return (0x0F)
            }
            Else
            {
                Return (Zero)
            }
        }
    ```
  
-Example
  -***SSDT-RTC0*** â€” Counterfeit RTC

    -Original device name: RTC
    -_HID: PNP0B00

    **Note**: The name of `LPCB` should be consistent with the original ACPI name.
